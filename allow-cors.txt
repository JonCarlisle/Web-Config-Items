This will allow CORS origin for all.

I have included the whole XML tree to show where this block needs to be placed.

This example sets access-control-allow-origin to any.

<configuration>
    <system.webServer>
        <httpProtocol>
            <customHeaders>
                <add name="Access-Control-Allow-Origin" value="*" />
            </customHeaders>
        </httpProtocol>
    </system.webServer>
</configuration>

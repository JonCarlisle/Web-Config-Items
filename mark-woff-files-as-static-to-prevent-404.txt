This will mark woff and woff2 filws as static content to prevent 404's in the console.

I have included the whole XML tree to show where this block needs to be placed.

<configuration>
    <system.webServer>
        <staticContent>
            <mimeMap fileExtension="woff" mimeType="application/font-woff" />
            <mimeMap fileExtension="woff2" mimeType="application/font-woff" />
        </staticContent>
    </system.webServer>
</configuration>

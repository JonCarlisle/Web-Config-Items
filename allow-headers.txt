This will enable specific headers.

I have included the whole XML tree to show where this block needs to be placed.

This example sets Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept and Authorization to allow.

<configuration>
    <system.webServer>
        <httpProtocol>
            <customHeaders>
                <add name="Access-Control-Allow-Headers" value="Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization" />
            </customHeaders>
        </httpProtocol>
    </system.webServer>
</configuration>

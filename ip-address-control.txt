This will allow or disallow specifi IP addresses.

I have included the whole XML tree to show where this block needs to be placed.

This example blocks the IP address 123.456.789.789.

<configuration>
    <system.webServer>
        <security>
            <ipSecurity>
                <add ipAddress="123.456.789.789" allowed="false" />
            </ipSecurity>
        </security>
    </system.webServer>
</configuration>

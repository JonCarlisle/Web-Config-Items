This will allow or disallow http verbs.

I have included the whole XML tree to show where this block needs to be placed.

This example allows the PUT verb.

<configuration>
    <system.webServer>
        <security>
            <requestFiltering>
                <verbs>
                    <add verb="PUT" allowed="true" />
                </verbs>
            </requestFiltering>
        </security>
    </system.webServer>
</configuration>
